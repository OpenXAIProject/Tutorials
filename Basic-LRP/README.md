LRP method for the explanation of non-linear classification
==

Python implementation of Taylor decomposition and simple LRP method for the explanation of non-linear classification desition.

## Reference Code 
Based on code by [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn-from-scratch.ipynb)

## Reference Paper 
**"Explaining nonlinear classification decisions with deep taylor decomposition"**. Gregoire Montavon, Sebastian Bach, Alexander Binder, Wojciech Samek, and Klaus-Robert Muller (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02479)

## Result  
This is a deep learning method to classify binary dataset. Our goal is to test how the LRP (more specifically deep Taylor Decomposition) can perform to depict the important time epochs and features from raw data.
